# Data Breach Response Plan

## 1. Introduction
This Data Breach Response Plan outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a personal data breach. The goal is to manage the breach effectively, minimize its impact, and comply with legal obligations under the GDPR.

## 2. Definition of a Data Breach
A personal data breach is a security incident leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.

**Examples:**
*   Access by an unauthorized third party.
*   Sending personal data to an incorrect recipient.
*   Computing devices containing personal data being lost or stolen.
*   Alteration of personal data without permission.
*   Loss of availability of personal data.

## 3. Response Team
*   **Incident Lead:** [Project Lead / CTO] - Responsible for overall management.
*   **Technical Lead:** [Lead Developer] - Responsible for technical investigation and containment.
*   **Legal/Compliance:** [DPO / Legal Advisor] - Responsible for legal assessment and notification.

## 4. Response Process

### Phase 1: Identification and Initial Assessment
*   **Detection:** Anyone who suspects a breach must report it immediately to the Incident Lead.
*   **Triage:** The Incident Lead determines if a breach has occurred and assesses its severity (High, Medium, Low risk to individuals).

### Phase 2: Containment and Recovery
*   **Immediate Action:** Take immediate steps to stop the breach (e.g., reset passwords, take systems offline, revoke access tokens).
*   **Isolation:** Isolate the affected systems to prevent spread.
*   **Backups:** Secure backups to ensure data integrity.

### Phase 3: Investigation and Risk Assessment
*   **Forensics:** Determine the cause, extent, and nature of the breach.
*   **Data Analysis:** Identify exactly what personal data was compromised (categories, number of records).
*   **Impact Analysis:** Assess the potential consequences for individuals (identity theft, fraud, distress).

### Phase 4: Notification
*   **Supervisory Authority (ICO):** If the breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, notify the ICO **within 72 hours** of becoming aware of the breach.
*   **Affected Individuals:** If the breach is likely to result in a **high risk** to the rights and freedoms of individuals, notify them without undue delay.
    *   Notification must include: Nature of the breach, name/contact of DPO, likely consequences, and measures taken.

### Phase 5: Post-Breach Review
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Why did it happen?
*   **Lessons Learned:** What worked well in the response? What didn't?
*   **Improvement Plan:** Update security measures, policies, and training to prevent recurrence.
