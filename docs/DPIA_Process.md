# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Process

## Overview

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a process designed to identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project. The GDPR requires a DPIA for processing that is likely to result in a high risk to individuals. This document outlines the process for conducting a DPIA within the ELSA Training Hub project.

## When to Conduct a DPIA

A DPIA is **mandatory** when:

*   Using new technologies (e.g., AI integration in the future).
*   Processing sensitive data on a large scale (e.g., if we start collecting special category data).
*   Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale.

A DPIA is **recommended** when:

*   Implementing a new feature that significantly changes how personal data is collected, stored, or processed.
*   Changing data retention policies.
*   Integrating with new third-party services.

## Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Project Lead / Developer:** Responsible for identifying the need for a DPIA and initiating the process.
*   **Data Protection Officer (DPO) / Privacy Lead:** Responsible for conducting the assessment, identifying risks, and recommending mitigation strategies.
*   **Stakeholders:** Provide input on the business need and potential impact.

## The DPIA Process Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Need for a DPIA
*   Does the project involve collecting new types of personal data?
*   Does it involve automated decision-making?
*   Does it involve sharing data with new third parties?
*   *If yes to any, proceed to Step 2.*

### Step 2: Describe the Processing
*   **Nature:** How will you collect, use, store, and delete data? (e.g., source of data, technology used).
*   **Scope:** What is the nature of the data? How much data? How many individuals?
*   **Context:** What is the relationship with the individuals? Do they expect this processing?
*   **Purpose:** Why do you want to process the data? What is the intended outcome?

### Step 3: Consultation
*   Seek the views of data subjects (users) if appropriate.
*   Consult with internal stakeholders (security, legal, etc.).

### Step 4: Assess Necessity and Proportionality
*   Is the processing necessary to achieve the purpose?
*   Is there a less intrusive way to achieve the same result?

### Step 5: Identify and Assess Risks
*   Identify sources of risk (e.g., unauthorized access, data loss, unwanted modification).
*   Assess the likelihood and severity of the impact on individuals (e.g., identity theft, discrimination, loss of confidentiality).

### Step 6: Identify Measures to Mitigate Risks
*   **Eliminate:** Can we avoid collecting the data?
*   **Reduce:** Can we anonymize or pseudonymize the data? Reduce retention periods?
*   **Accept:** Are the remaining risks acceptable given the benefits?

### Step 7: Sign-off and Record Outcomes
*   Document the DPIA findings.
*   Get sign-off from the DPO/Privacy Lead.
*   Integrate the mitigation measures into the project plan.

## Documentation Template

*   **Project Name:**
*   **Date:**
*   **Description of Processing:**
*   **Assessment of Risks:**
    *   Risk 1: [Description] (Likelihood: High/Med/Low, Severity: High/Med/Low) -> Mitigation: [Action]
*   **DPO Advice:**
*   **Outcome:** Approved / Rejected

## Review

The DPIA should be reviewed regularly, especially if there is a change in the risk presented by the processing operation.
