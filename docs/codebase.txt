# Codebase Overview: ELSA Training Hub

This document provides a detailed explanation of the ELSA Training Hub application's codebase. It is intended to help developers understand the project structure, key components, and overall architecture.

## 1. Technology Stack

The application is built with a modern, component-based stack:

- **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Library:** React
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** ShadCN UI
- **Generative AI:** Genkit
- **Authentication (Mock):** A simulated authentication flow is in place for demonstration purposes.

## 2. Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js structure, with key logic organized inside the `src` directory.

```

├── src/
│   ├── app/                # Next.js App Router: pages, layouts, and routes
│   │   ├── (app)/          # Group for authenticated routes (e.g., dashboard)
│   │   ├── (auth)/         # Group for authentication routes (e.g., login)

```

### Key Directories Explained:

- **`src/app`**: This is the core of the Next.js application.
    - **Route Groups `(app)` and `(auth)`**: These folders group related routes without affecting the URL path. `(app)` contains all pages behind the mock authentication, sharing a common layout (`src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`). `(auth)` contains the login and registration pages, sharing a simpler, centered layout.
    - **`page.tsx`**: The main component for a specific URL path.
    - **`layout.tsx`**: A component that wraps page components, defining a shared UI for a route and its children.

- **`src/components`**: Contains all reusable React components.
    - **`ui/`**: This directory holds the base UI components provided by ShadCN (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Input`). They are highly customizable and form the building blocks of the interface.
    - **`auth/`**: Contains the `LoginForm` and `RegisterForm`, which handle user input and mock submission.
    - **`layout/`**: Holds components that define the application's main structure, such as the `Header`, `MainNav` (the sidebar navigation), and `UserNav` (the user profile dropdown).

- **`src/hooks`**: Home for custom React hooks.
    - **`use-toast.ts`**: A custom hook for displaying toast notifications.
    - **`use-mobile.ts`**: A hook to detect if the user is on a mobile-sized screen, used for responsive layouts (like the collapsible sidebar).

- **`src/lib`**: Contains helper and utility functions.
    - **`utils.ts`**: Includes the `cn` function, which merges Tailwind CSS classes intelligently, making conditional styling cleaner.

- **`src/ai`**: This directory is designated for all Generative AI functionality using Genkit.
    - **`genkit.ts`**: Initializes and configures the global Genkit `ai` instance.
    - **`dev.ts`**: The entry point for running Genkit flows in development.
    - It would also contain a `flows` subdirectory for individual AI flow definitions.

## 3. Styling and Theming

- **Tailwind CSS**: The primary tool for styling. It's a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development directly in the markup.
- **`src/app/globals.css`**: This file sets up the base styles and, most importantly, defines the application's theme using CSS variables. Colors for `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, `background`, etc., are defined here in HSL format. This allows for easy theme changes and consistency across all components.
- **ShadCN UI**: The components in `src/components/ui` are built on top of Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS according to the theme defined in `globals.css`. They are not from a typical component library; instead, you own the code, making them fully customizable.
- **Fonts**: The application uses 'Inter' for body text and 'Space Grotesk' for headlines, configured in `src/app/layout.tsx` and `tailwind.config.ts`.

## 4. How It Functions

### Application Flow & Routing

1.  **Entry Point**: The root page (`src/app/page.tsx`) redirects users to `/login`.
2.  **Authentication**:
    - The `/login` and `/register` routes are handled by the `(auth)` route group.
    - The forms in `src/components/auth/` use `react-hook-form` for state management and `zod` for validation.
    - Upon "successful" submission (currently a mock), the user is redirected to the `/dashboard`.
3.  **Authenticated Experience**:
    - All routes within the `(app)` group are for authenticated users.
    - The layout in `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` establishes the main UI shell, which includes the `Header` and the `Sidebar`.
    - The sidebar (`src/components/layout/main-nav.tsx`) provides navigation between the main pages: Dashboard, Resources, Certificates, etc.
    - The main content for each page is rendered where `{children}` is placed in the layout.

### State Management

- **UI State**: Primarily managed by React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`). For example, the sidebar's open/closed state is managed within the `SidebarProvider` component.
- **Form State**: Handled by `react-hook-form` for efficiency and to simplify validation and submission logic.
- **Global State**: For this application's scale, global state management (like Redux or Zustand) is not currently necessary. Context API is used for localized state sharing, such as in the `SidebarProvider`.
