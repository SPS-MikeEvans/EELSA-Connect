# ELSA Training Hub: Firebase Setup Instructions

Follow these steps carefully to configure your Firebase project. This is a crucial step to ensure the application works correctly after deployment.

## Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click on "**Add project**".
3.  Enter a name for your project (e.g., "ELSA Training Hub").
4.  You can choose to enable or disable Google Analytics. It's not required for this application to function.
5.  Click "**Create project**". Wait for the project to be created.

## Step 2: Create a Web App in Your Firebase Project

1.  Inside your new project, you'll see a message "Get started by adding Firebase to your app".
2.  Click on the **Web icon** (it looks like `</>`).
3.  Enter an "App nickname" (e.g., "ELSA Hub Web App").
4.  **Do NOT** check the box for "Also set up Firebase Hosting for this app". We will do this later.
5.  Click "**Register app**".

## Step 3: Get Your Firebase Credentials

1.  After registering the app, Firebase will show you your `firebaseConfig` object. It will look like this:

    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "...",
      appId: "1:..."
    };
    ```

2.  **Copy this entire object.** We need to put these values into your codebase.

## Step 4: Create the `.env.local` File

1.  In the root directory of your project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
2.  Paste the Firebase configuration you copied into this file, but format it like the example below. **You must add `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to the beginning of each key name.**

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project-id.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project-id.appspot.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:..."
    ```

3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project credentials.
4.  Save the `.env.local` file.

## Step 5: Enable Authentication

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the "**Build**" section in the left-hand menu and click on "**Authentication**".
2.  Click the "**Get started**" button.
3.  In the "Sign-in method" tab, click on "**Email/Password**" from the list of providers.
4.  **Enable** the "Email/Password" provider.
5.  Click "**Save**".

## Step 6: Set Up Firestore Database

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the "**Build**" section and click on "**Firestore Database**".
2.  Click the "**Create database**" button.
3.  Select "**Start in production mode**".
4.  Click "**Next**".
5.  Choose a location for your Firestore data (choose the one closest to your users).
6.  Click "**Enable**".

## Step 7: Apply Firestore Security Rules

1.  In the Firestore Database section, click on the "**Rules**" tab at the top.
2.  Delete all the existing content in the rules editor.
3.  Open the `firestore.rules` file from your project's root directory.
4.  Copy the entire contents of the `firestore.rules` file.
5.  Paste the contents into the Firestore rules editor in the Firebase Console.
6.  Click "**Publish**".

## Step 8: Deploy to Firebase Hosting

If you have the Firebase CLI installed, you can now deploy your project.

1.  Open your terminal in the root directory of the project.
2.  If you haven't initialized Firebase in this project yet, run:
    `firebase init hosting`
    - Select "**Use an existing project**" and choose the Firebase project you created.
    - When asked for your public directory, type: `out`
    - When asked to configure as a single-page app, type: `y` (Yes).
    - When asked to set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub, type `N` (No) for now.

3.  Build your Next.js application for production:
    `npm run build`

4.  Deploy your application to Firebase Hosting:
    `firebase deploy --only hosting`

Once the deployment is complete, you can visit the hosting URL provided in the terminal to see your live application!
