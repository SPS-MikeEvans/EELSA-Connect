- 'Inter', a clean and readable sans-serif font, is used for all body text.
- 'Space Grotesk', a modern and stylish sans-serif font, is used for titles and major headings to add a contemporary feel.
- Icons are used consistently and purposefully for navigation, file type identification, and actions. They should be clear, easily recognizable, and enhance usability without causing distraction.
